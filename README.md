<h1> Combat 2022 </h1>
<p> Combat 2022 is a simple top down arcade tank shooter game inspired by the 1977 game Combat. It was made as part of a university course at Swansea University 
  that was aimed at teaching a number of programming principles and techniques involved with video game programming, particularly in the Unity/C# environment. It
  was made primarily over the course of around 2-3 weeks and serves to demonstrate understanding of the course material. Although it was never really intended to be
  played by the public, a functioning build is available on itch.io for anyone interested in seeing it in action.
